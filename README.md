# single_stub_matching (in ADS)

In this repository, we simulate a single stub matching circuit. You may be familiar with the concept of a single stub matching circuit from prior experiments. In this exercise, our goal is to simulate an open-circuit single stub matching circuit.

Circuit Design
Design a single stub matching circuit with a characteristic impedance of 50 ohms to match a load consisting of a series combination of a coil with a value of 6.37 nanohenries and a resistor with a value of 100 ohms at a frequency of 2 GHz. The desired parameters for this single stub matching circuit are as follows:

Frequency (f) = 2 GHz
Distance (d) = 0.3697λ
Length (ℓ) = 0.1477λ
Tasks
a) Draw the schematic diagram of the circuit and perform a parameter scattering simulation over the frequency range from 1 to 3 GHz.

b) Plot the VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio) as a function of frequency.

c) Plot the real part of the input impedance as a function of frequency.

d) Plot the parameter 11S in dB over the frequency range from 1 to 3 GHz on both a rectangular and a Smith chart. Adjust the Y-axis range on the rectangular plot from -40 dB to 0 dB.

e) Calculate the bandwidth for a 10 dB return loss for the impedance matching circuit.

Feel free to use appropriate simulation tools and software to conduct these simulations and visualize the results.
